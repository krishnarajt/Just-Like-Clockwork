# Just-Like-Clockwork

A Lap Timer to record what work is done hourly, and export a report for the same, so I can charge an hourly work rate for Freelancing

# Features

1. You can split laps if you were working on something for too long and forgot to log it! If this was a mistake, you can merge them too!

# To Do

- Add Backend for this to store sessions more permanently, and to sync across devices.
- Add a Pomodoro timer mode, which will have a work and break timer, and will automatically switch between them.
- Add a feature to track time spent on different projects, and generate reports based on that.

# Made with:

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router
- Tabler Icons
- Daisy UI

I had a lot of fun making this. In fact I stopped doing the actual work which I was supposed to do for making this instead. I had made this a while back, and have been using it for a long time now at work to track the things done throughout the day. I then usually export the csv and paste it on Notion to track it.

So special thanks to all of these projects that made this one possible. I hope you have fun using this!
